Second Odin Project

Second attempt at making my first odin project
Made sure and followed the instructions properly this time
Found a way to fix the image linking issues that i have dealt with in the past
When linking a page that is the current folder, use '../' in front of the file to tell the system to look outside this folder
Was a pretty easy project overall, looking forward to doing more
